                            Hi, my name is Tatiana Orlova, I am a sensorial art teacher. Three years ago I moved to Austin, bringing with me a strong background in education and creativity. I hold a Masterâ€™s degree in Education and currently work in a Montessori preschool, which gives me valuable Montessori experience in guiding childrenâ€™s natural curiosity and independence.
                            </p>
                            <p className="text-xl text-medium max-w-3xl mx-auto mb-8">
                            I specialize in mixed sensorial art  &mdash;  a creative approach that combines drawing, hands-on modeling, and tactile exploration. My projects are designed to support the development of fine motor skills and speech development, while engaging children in imaginative, playful experiences. I love guiding students through the process of creating art projects where we not only make visual pieces but also invent and tell stories and fairy tales during the creative journey.
                            </p>
                            <p className="text-xl text-medium max-w-3xl mx-auto mb-8">
                            I offer classes not only for children but also for adults, where tactile art becomes a way to ground yourself, relax, and release stress. It is pure creativity without barriers, a form of art that feels like therapy for the soul.
                            </p>

                            ðŸŒ¿ Join my classes and experience the joy of creating with your handsâ€”whether for growth, relaxation, or simple artistic pleasure.
